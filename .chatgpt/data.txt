This file outlines how data is stored within FooConvert.

FooConvert allows you to create 3 different types of widgets, which are stored as custom post types within WordPress.

Bar widgets use the post type "fc-bar".

Flyout widgets use the post type "fc-flyout".

Popup widgets use the post type "fc-popup".

The FooConvert plugin creates a single custom database table in the database when the plugin is installed.

The table is called "fooconvert_events", and it's purpose is to store events for widgets analytics.

The SQL statement for creating the "fooconvert_events" table is:

CREATE TABLE fooconvert_events (
    id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    widget_id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
    event_type varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    event_subtype varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    conversion tinyint(1) DEFAULT NULL,
    sentiment tinyint(1) DEFAULT NULL,
    page_url text DEFAULT NULL,
    device_type varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
    anonymous_user_guid varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
    user_id bigint(20) unsigned DEFAULT NULL,
    extra_data longtext DEFAULT NULL,
    timestamp datetime DEFAULT $timestamp_default,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

An explanation of each field in the "fooconvert_events" table:
 - "id" is the primary key.
 - "widget_id" is the id of the widget that created the event. this is a foreign key to the WordPress post table.
 - "event_type" is the type of event. This is the most important field. It must be one of: 'open', 'click', 'close', 'update'.
 - "event_subtype" is the subtype of the event. Can be either 'engagement' or NULL.
 - "conversion" is a boolean that is true if the event is a conversion.
 - "sentiment" is a boolean that is true if the event sentiment is positive, false if it is negative, and null if it is neutral.
 - "page_url" is the url of the page that created the event.
 - "device_type" is the type of device when the event happened.
 - "user_id" is the WordPress user when the event happened. Will be null if not logged in.
 - "anonymous_user_guid" is the unique id of an anonymous user from the frontend. Will be null if logged in.
 - "extra_data" holds any extra data associated with the event. It can hold specific info about a conversion or an update.
 - "timestamp" is when the event happened.

There is a default retention period of 14 days for widget analytics. All event data older than the retention period is deleted in a daily cron job.
