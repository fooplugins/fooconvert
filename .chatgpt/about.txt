This file outlines what the FooConvert plugin does.

FooConvert allows you to create 3 different types of widgets: bars, flyouts, and popups.

FooConvert has a widget designer, which allows you to create and edit widgets using the Gutenberg block editor.

When you create a new widget, you can choose to start from a predefined template or start from scratch.

You can customize the appearance and behavior of each widget, with the following options:
 - Display Rules : this controls where the widget is displayed. Examples : all pages, on a specific page, on a specific post type, etc.
 - Open Trigger : this controls when the widget is opened. Examples : on page load, on page scroll, on timer, on anchor click, on exit intent, etc.
 - Appearance : you control the style, colors, size and layout of the widget.
 - Content : you can embed any block or shortcode within the widget.

FooConvert has an admin dashboard, which displays the following panels:
 - Getting started : a quick way to create demo widgets, or how to get started and create your first widget.
 - Top Performers : displays the top performing widgets (for example by engagements and views).
 - Help : links to support and documentation.
 - Premium Addons : a list of premium addons that extend the functionality of FooConvert.

There is also an admin page for Widget Stats, which shows the metrics and a recent activity chart for your widgets.
Metrics include total events, views, visitors and engagements.
The recent activity chart shows the daily number of events, views, visitors and engagements for the last 14 days.
